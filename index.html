        This ePortfolio displays the knowlege and skills I have gained throughout my time studying Computer Science as well as designing and developing the enhacnments for my Inventory Helper app, as part of the Computer Science Capstone at SNHU. Somne of my achievements include making the honor every term I have been at SNHU as well as seral deans lists.

    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">   My work on my ePortfolio as well as my work throughout the program has given me a diverse and versatile set of skills in software development and computer science as a whole. After many long nights I am proud of the skills I have developed to enter the computer science field. 
        <br>
            Software engineering was my chosen “focus” of my degree. Meaning I took extra classes that studied the entire software development lifecycle. Each spoke in the wheel was heavily focused on giving me a solid understanding of each person's role as well as frameworks like agile, scum, or waterfall. The course “Software Development Lifecycle” covered a variety of topics like user stories, sprints, and the other phases of agile development.
        <br>
            Collaborating in a team environment was a big part of the program. Every course encourages its students to solve problems and work together, with weekly discussion posts and other forums open to all students. Helping other students and getting help in turn has taught me a lot about the value of tackling big problems together instead of powering through it on your own. It is important to be independently capable but if something is not working it’s time to try something new.
        <br>
            Another skill the program developed across multiple courses is communicating with stakeholders/clients. It is very easy to use shorthand terms or jargon to explain functionality or other technical concepts but your stakeholders or clients will have no idea what you are talking about. Many courses like System Analysis and Design, Software Development Lifecycle, or even Software Security dealt with this. They also go into the importance of focusing on things like meeting requirements and their desired outcomes. 
        <br>
            Data structures and algorithms were another important cornerstone of the program. A solid knowledge base of how to properly utilize and when to utilize is important for any programmer. Courses like “Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design” focused on dissecting some of the more popular ones like vectors, hash tables and binary search trees. Our final project for that course involved writing pseudo code and creating runtime analysis charts, calculating the cost and runtime for each method (that utilized them in varying ways) in Big-O notation, both individually and together. 
        <br>
            Several of my courses saw me deal with Databases. One of the earliest courses of the program, “Introduction to Structured Database Environments” got me familiar working within a mySQL database, and storing and manipulating the data within. I would further my experience with more practical applications in later courses utilizing a NoSQL database for “Full Stack Development I” and a SQLite database in the artifact showcased in my ePortfolio.
        <br>
            Security is something that should always be in mind when you are programming or developing anything. The courses “Secure Coding” and “Software Security” focused on this. For example, a project for Software Security had me recommend an encryption algorithm cipher to verify files in the form of a checksum when the web application is transferring data. The project also dealt with deploying the cipher, dependency checks, as well as refactoring some of the web applications code. Secure Coding taught me about different security vulnerabilities like injection attacks, or buffer overflow. It also gave me experience developing a security policy for a fictional company that focused on “Defence in Depth” and a presentation outlining the policy and the specific threats this company's projects were likely to face and how much of a priority they wer</p>

    <p style="font-size: large;">Self Assessment: The Artifact</p>    
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">   This artifact was chosen because it encompasses almost all of the experience I have gained with software design, algorithms, data structures, and databases. The artifact is an inventory management application made in android studio. It allows the user to create, edit and maintain a list of items, with a strong focus on versatility in its design, meaning it is designed to be useful for multiple applications. This design is carried through throughout the app, in all functionality and elements. The enhancements improved the overall time complexity dramatically by eliminating many costly parts of the code like for loops for better more effective solutions, and implementing other functionally to better support the design of the app like sorting and searching. Additionally this artifact showcases my experience with databases through the apps use of SQLite, and full CRUD capability and security in mind. I wanted to develop it further after that course was over and I am excited to continue to do so in the future.</p>
