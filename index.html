    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; text-align: center;">
        This ePortfolio displays the knowlege and skills I have gained throughout my time studying Computer Science as well as designing and 
        developing the enhacnments for my Inventory Helper app, as part of the Computer Science Capstone at SNHU. Somne of my achievements include 
        making the honor every term I have been at SNHU as well as seral deans lists.

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: center;">Self Assessment: Strengths</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">My work on my ePortfolio as well as my work throughout the program has given me a diverse and 
        versatile set of skills in software development and computer science as a whole. After many long nights I am proud of the skills I have developed 
        to enter the computer science field. </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">Software engineering was my chosen “focus” of my degree. Meaning I took extra classes that studied the entire 
        software development lifecycle. Each spoke in the wheel was heavily focused on giving me a solid understanding of each person's role as well as frameworks like 
        agile, scum, or waterfall. The course “Software Development Lifecycle” covered a variety of topics like user stories, sprints, and the other phases of agile development.</p>
        
    <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">Collaborating in a team environment was a big part of the program. Every course encourages its students to 
        solve problems and work together, with weekly discussion posts and other forums open to all students. Helping other students and getting help in turn has 
        taught me a lot about the value of tackling big problems together instead of powering through it on your own. It is important to be independently capable 
        but if something is not working it’s time to try something new.</p>
        
    <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">Another skill the program developed across multiple courses is communicating with stakeholders/clients. It is very easy 
        to use shorthand terms or jargon to explain functionality or other technical concepts but your stakeholders or clients will have no idea what you are talking about. 
        Many courses like System Analysis and Design, Software Development Lifecycle, or even Software Security dealt with this. They also go into the importance of focusing on 
        things like meeting requirements and their desired outcomes. </p>
        
    <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">Data structures and algorithms were another important cornerstone of the program. A solid knowledge base of how to 
        properly utilize and when to utilize is important for any programmer. Courses like “Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design” focused on dissecting 
        some of the more popular ones like vectors, hash tables and binary search trees. Our final project for that course involved writing pseudo code and creating 
        runtime analysis charts, calculating the cost and runtime for each method (that utilized them in varying ways) in Big-O notation, both individually and together. </p>
        
    <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">Several of my courses saw me deal with Databases. One of the earliest courses of the program, 
        “Introduction to Structured Database Environments” got me familiar working within a mySQL database, and storing and manipulating the data within. 
        I would further my experience with more practical applications in later courses utilizing a NoSQL database for “Full Stack Development I” and a SQLite 
        database in the artifact showcased in my ePortfolio.</p>
        
    <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">Security is something that should always be in mind when you are programming or developing anything. 
        The courses “Secure Coding” and “Software Security” focused on this. For example, a project for Software Security had me recommend an encryption 
        algorithm cipher to verify files in the form of a checksum when the web application is transferring data. The project also dealt with deploying 
        the cipher, dependency checks, as well as refactoring some of the web applications code. Secure Coding taught me about different security vulnerabilities like 
        injection attacks, or buffer overflow. It also gave me experience developing a security policy for a fictional company that focused on “Defence in Depth” and 
        a presentation outlining the policy and the specific threats this company's projects were likely to face and how much of a priority they wer</p>

        The following links are to the code review for the Inventory Helper source code and a look into some of the enhacnments that were planned for CS 499.

    <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">For CS499 we were tasked with chooseing one to three artifacts that showcased our skills in three catigories: 
        Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, as well as databases. The artifact I chose is an inventory management application made in android studio. 
        It allows the user to create, edit and maintain a list of items, with a strong focus on versatility in its design, meaning it is designed to be useful for multiple 
        applications. This design is carried through throughout the app, in all functionality and elements. This shows my ability to design and develop a project 
        with specific goals and requirements in mind. </p>

    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">Further enhacnments included sorting and search functionality as well as efficency improvents by eliminating and substituting costly lines of code 
        like for loops. This portion of the project has shown me how far I have come as a programmer. Before the enhancements, there were too many for loops. For example, 
        the app would do a linear search though the item’s array list multiple times in multiple places. In addition, the method to display the items to the recycler view, 
        I had a loop that would do this just to create another list with the same information to be used later! I truly have no idea what I was thinking back then. 
        Nearly all loops have been completely eliminated. Originally I planned on making the linear searches binary searches (this was in my outline), 
        but as I worked on the enhancements I realized even those were not necessary with some adjustments. The app instead relies on passing information like indexes 
        between activities or storing it in hidden ui elements instead of searching for the information every time it is needed.

    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">This artifact shows my ability to create and maintain a database(s) for my applications and other solutions with a secure mindset. 
        Furthermore, it underlines my ability to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. </p>

    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">Enhancing this artifact has taught me a lot. More specifically about working with an existing project, fixing its design flaws 
        and enhancing it while also staying in line with the initial requirements of the project. There were a number of exceptions and odd behavior I had to track down. 
        Moreover, I have learned how far I have come, fixing my old mistakes.</p>
